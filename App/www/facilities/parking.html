        <p>
          Parking is always a contentious issue in any work place though we aim to make this experience as pleasant as possible. Concept house has its own on site, secured, multi-storey car park as well as a number of uncovered bays.
        </p>
        <p>
          An on-site parking space is not a guarantee though, on peak working days (which tend to be Tuesday to Thursdays) there may not been any free spaces left after a certain time, on these occasions you are able to use the car park in Tredegar Park which is
          reasonably close to the office.
        </p>
        <p>
          However you should be aware that the IPO takes no responsibility for cars and belongings parked in Tredegar Park. If you are part of the car-share scheme you may be eligible for a reserved bay.
