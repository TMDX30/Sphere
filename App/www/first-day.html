        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">What to bring</div>
        <p>
          It might be useful to bring a pen but general stationary will likely be provided to you. If you have been asked to bring any additional documents in your welcome pack, please make sure that you have them to hand. You may bring your own lunch if you like.
          We have a canteen, shop, coffee shop and cash machine on site, all of which are very close to one another. More information is available in the <a href="facilities/facilities-index.html">facilities section</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find that there is a kitchen near your team. You may bring your own tea / coffee / milk, or alternatively buy it from the shop. In most areas there will be a 'Milk Club', where you will have the option to pay into a collection and share a large
          container of milk.

        <p>
          The average dress code will likely vary depending upon which department you are working in. The office recommends 'smart casual' clothing (yes we know that can be a frustratingly vague term, sorry!). On your first day, we recommend to play it safe and
          dress on the smarter end of the spectrum. In the following days you will quickly be able to assess how your area dresses. If in doubt, you can contact your line manager or <a href="mailto:hradvisors@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Dress%20Code"
            target="_top" class="link external">HR</a> for advice beforehand.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Where to go</div>
        <p>
          On the morning of your first day go to IPO main reception where the front desk staff will be able to assist you. You will be given a temporary photographic pass for the day but will get a permanent pass within the week. The main desk will then notify
          a member of your new team who will welcome you to the office. It may take a while to get used to finding your way around. If you are ever lost, be sure to ask someone and they will happily direct you to wherever you may need to go
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">What to expect</div>
        <p>
          All new members of staff are required to undergo a security briefing by the IPO Secure Team on their first day. This has to be completed before you are given your login credentials for IT and issued with your staff pass. Usually, a security briefing is
          pre-booked for the morning of your first day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be briefed on your working hours shortly after you start. These are usually more rigid for the first week's due to training / workshops / briefings etc. If agreed with your manager, you will be able to take advantage our flexible working patterns
          depending on your role.
