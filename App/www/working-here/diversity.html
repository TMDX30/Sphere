        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Introduction</div>
        <p>
          Equality is concerned with ensuring that everyone is given equal access to opportunities which allow them to contribute and participate fully and fairly in the workplace and in society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equality is about removing barriers. It doesn't mean excluding some people or giving one group preferential treatment over another, although sometimes we can take steps to help remove the barriers faced by certain groups; for example, providing wheelchair
          access to public buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to a working life free from discrimination, victimisation or harassment.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">LGBT</div>
        <p>
          The IPO has its own LGBT network called iPride. iPride aims to promote inclusivity and encourage participation from its members. They provide confidential support and advice on sexual orientation or gender identity issues. They also aim to update colleagues
          interested in LGBT matters, and most of all provide a means of peer support between LGBT staff. iPride organises regular social events for members and is open to all who are supportive of the LGBT+ community.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Disability</div>
        <p>
          Concept House aims to be fully accessible for all of its staff members. The office has disability access at all entrances and provides lifts for ease of access to all floors. Disabled toilets are located on each floor within close proximity of male and
          female toilets. The canteen and shop are fully wheelchair accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a disability or suffer from a long-term health condition, you should discuss any concerns about working arrangements you may have with your line manager. This will ensure that any reasonable adjustments can be put into place and that you have
          access to the support and assistance available from the Office and colleagues.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Mental Health</div>
        <p>
          A mental health problem is just as significant as any other physical illness â€“ only you cannot always see it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value the physical and mental health of our people and our Mental Health Strategy sets out our vision of an organisation where mental health issues are widely understood and de-stigmatised. Our people will feel confident to talk about their mental
          health and know that the Office will help and support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are numerous resources and support networks available in the office, including access to trained staff counsellors who can offer independent help and advice, as well as mental health support groups. More information can be found on Circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a mental health peer-to-peer support group which meets weekly. At each session, we have a relevant topic for discussion such as "Living with OCD", "My depression", "I am not my illness", "Toxic People" and "How can Social Media effect mental health".
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone volunteers to lead each discussion but there is absolutely no pressure to do so. We also reserve some time for general discussion and to talk about how the group can grow and develop. Whilst being strictly confidential, conversations are very
          informal and free and easy with no expectation on people to contribute if they don't want to - to sit and listen is absolutely fine.
