          The IPO pays its staff on a monthly basis normally on the penultimate working day of each month. The pay you receive in your first month will be worked out using your start date. It is calculated against the number of days you have worked since starting,
          in the given monthly pay cycle. Thereafter, it will revert to your standard monthly salary.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Ensuring your details are correct</div>
        <p>
          To ensure that you get paid on time, it is vitally important that you have completed and returned all the relevant documentation that has been sent to you by the Recruitment team. In the event that your financial information changes, you can use the IPO
          self-service HR system; ‘iTrent’ to update your personal details.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be a session during your induction to go over your financial information and make sure it is correct.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Help and support</div>
        <p>
          If you are used to receiving weekly payments and are struggling with moving to a monthly payment scheme, you can request assistance from the HR and Payroll team. In exceptional circumstances you may be able to receive a fortnightly payment for the current
          month only.
