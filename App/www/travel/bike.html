          The office offers a pool bike scheme which provides bikes as well as bike safety equipment for staff to borrow, and is available for all IPO staff. More information can be obtained by emailing the Sustainability Team.

          The office also provides secure lockers for those who cycle or motorbike to work. Keys for lockers can be obtained from Accommodation. There are also showering and changing facilities as well as tumble dryers for when the weather is a little wet!
        </p>
        <p>
          We have quite a few staff who cycle to work and you will be able to find out about the best routes etc. from our <a href="mailto:SustainabilityTeam@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Bike%20routes" target="_top" class="link external">Sustainability Team.</a>.
          There is a cycling map of Newport displayed outside the staff entrance, and we have a staff cyclist mailing list which can provide more information on cycle routes and other cycling queries. The office also runs a cyclist buddy scheme for those
          who may be a little more apprehensive about cycling in to work on their own.
