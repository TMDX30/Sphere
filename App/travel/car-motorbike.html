                    If you plan on driving to work, the barriers are operated automatically by a vehicle number plate recognition system.  In order to avoid causing any delays to traffic getting onto the site it is essential that you provide us with the following details of your vehicle in advance:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Registration number
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Colour
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Register your vehicle</div>
                <p>
                    Please email the above details to <a href="mailto:accommodation@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Vehicle%20Registration%20Information" target="_top" class="external">accommodation@ipo.gov.uk</a> as a matter of priority.  If you do not provide these details, you will be stopped by security on entering the site. Providing that you confirm these details with them, they will be able to direct you where to appropriately park.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, they will provide you with a reserved parking bay which is outside the office's entrance. Alternatively, there is a multi-storey car park located on-site which they may direct you to. Once your car details are logged with Accommodation, you shouldn't be stopped at the security desk and you should then be able to drive straight on to the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be aware of the large sign on your left before the Security Hut. If your number plate has not been recognised by the system, then your registration number will flash up on this sign. This indicates that youâ€™ll need to pull into the lay-by just after the sign and speak to the guards using the intercom system. Being aware of this will allow for an easy-flow of traffic and avoid congestion behind you.
