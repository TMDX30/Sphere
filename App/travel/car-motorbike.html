                    If you plan on driving to work, the barriers are operated automatically by a vehicle number plate recognition service. In order to avoid causing any delays to regular traffic while getting onto the site, it is essential that you provide us with the following
                    details of your vehicle in advance:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Registration number
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Model
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Colour

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Register your vehicle</div>
                <p>
                    Please email the above details to <a href="mailto:accommodation@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Vehicle%20Registration%20Information" target="_top" class="external">accommodation@ipo.gov.uk</a> <b>as a matter of priority</b>. If you do not provide these
                    details, you will be stopped by security on entering the site. Providing that you confirm these details with them, they will be able to direct you where to appropriately park.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Parking facilities</div>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, they will provide you with a reserved parking bay which is outside the office's entrance. Alternatively, there is a multi-storey car park located on-site which they may direct you to. Once your car details are logged with the accommodation
                    department, you shouldn't be stopped at the security desk and you can drive straight on-site.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Motorbike</div>
                <p>
                    You should register your motorbike the same way you would a car. The multi-storey car park has speciality parking spaces reserved for motorbikes on the ground floor.
