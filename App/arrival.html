                    If you are travelling with your own vehicle and your registration is not yet on our system you will likely be stopped by security. There is an electronic sign that will display your number plate to warn you in advance. If this happens, please stop in the layby shortly before the security gate. This will help free up the entrance for authorised vehicles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is an intercom box that will allow you to communicate with our security team. They will likely be expecting you. If you tell them your name and that you are a new starter, they will be able to verify your identity. They will finally be able to direct you to the multi-storey car park.

                    If you want to enter the office on foot, you will be met by a tunstyle next to the main security box. You will require an access card to get through. If you do not have an access card there is a button you can press to get the security guards attention.
