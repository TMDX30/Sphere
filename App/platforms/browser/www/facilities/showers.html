          As well as showering facilities available in the gym changing rooms, there are further showers available for those who cycle to and from the office. These are in self-contained cubicles. If you have difficulty finding them, just ask another member of
          staff who will assist you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjacent to the shower facilities, there are a limited number of lockers available which you can book via Accommodation. There is a long waiting list to be allocated a locker so it is good advice to make this request as early as possible if you wish to
          use the locker facilities.
