        <p>
          The IPO values the health of its employees and encourages an active life style and have been awarded the Silver Corporate Health Standard Award by Public Health Wales in recognition of this. We have our very own gym on site that is available to all staff
          with showers and changing facilities located nearby.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">CSCC</div>
        <p>
          To join you need to be a member of the Civil Service Sports Council which has an annual subscription of just £25. This is cheaper than the monthly cost of the majority of gyms! However, if the IPO gym is not for you, you may also be able to get a discount
          on the monthly cost of a local gym
        </p>
        <p>
          Subscription to CSSC is £3.70 per month, which can also be deducted through payroll monthly or paid annually. When you become a CSSC member you will receive a Countdown savings card which entitles you to receive a discount at many high street stores.
          More information on the discount scheme offered by the CSSC can be found on their <a href="https://www.cssc.co.uk/" target="_blank">website</a>.

        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Personal Trainer</div>
        <p>
          The gym offers members free one on one sessions with a qualified personal trainer. These sessions can be adjusted to meet your needs. A personal trainer can help you develop a personalised fitness plan, monitor your progress or simply provide you with
          a good grounding in fitness activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the IPO offers a number of more specialised fitness classes. These can be a great opportunity to socialise with other people in the office. Some examples include; Yoga, Kettlebells, Zumba and running groups. The cost of each session will
          vary. A full list can be found on Circle under ‘Wellbeing’ and then ‘Be Active’.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>All these activities must be carried out in your own time, so you need to be keyed out of the flexi system.</b>
