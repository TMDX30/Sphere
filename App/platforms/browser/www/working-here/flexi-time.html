        <p>
          Our full time working hours are 37 hours per week (7 hours and 24 minutes per day), not including lunch breaks. We do however offer a flexible working system.
        </p>
        <p>
          With your manager’s agreement, you can work between 05:00am and 10:00pm and there are no core hours. However, some business areas have more specific requirements so the full bandwidth may not be available to you. For your first few day(s) or week(s) we
          will probably have set up a few induction sessions and meetings. This means you will probably need to be here at specific times. As you settle in, you can discuss with your manager what normal hours will suit you and your team.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">How flexi time works</div>
        <p>
          Your working hours will be recorded on our internal time keeping system, Etarmis®. There are flexi terminals located around the office, at entrances and main thoroughfares, where you can clock in and out using your staff ID pass. You can also do this
          by using the Etarmis® software that should be installed on your PC.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a flexi month your time allowance should not drop below -11 hours 06 minutes (-1½ days). Anytime past this level of debit will likely get you into trouble. Conversely it should not exceed +14 hours 48 minutes (+2 days). Any time above this level of
          credit will be lost at the end of the flexi month. The flexi cut-off date will be displayed on screens around the office, on our internal communications site (circle) or can be confirmed with <a href="mailto:hradvisors@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Flexi%20Cut%20Off%20Date"
            target="_top" class="link external">HR</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to build up flexi time beyond the +2 days upper allowance; however, this must be for a specific reason (e.g. a holiday) and HR should be notified.
