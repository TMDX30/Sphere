          The Office is committed to maintaining a safe working environment for everyone. In accordance with Health and Safety Display Screen Equipment Regulations (1992), employers are required to provide appropriate eye tests for staff working with Display Screen
          Equipment (DSE).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work with computers and wish to have an eye test, contact the <a href="mailto:hradvisors@ipo.gov.uk?Subject=Eye%20test" target="_top" class="link external">HR advisors</a> who can provide more information. HR will provide you with a form
          for yourself and your optician to fill out. Once you have handed the form back to HR you will be reimbursed for the cost of the eye test up to a limit of £20.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eye tests will be funded every 2 years, unless you have an underlying condition that requires an annual eye test.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The office will meet the cost of DSE corrective glasses up to a limit of £60 if prescribed by the optician.
        </p>
        <p>
          The office can also issue vouchers under the Spec Savers Corporate Eye Care Voucher Scheme should you wish to use Spec Savers Opticians. These vouchers entitle you to one free eye test, and, if prescribed, a pair of glasses solely for DSE use from the
          Spec Saver £45.00 frame range. These vouchers can also be obtained through HR.
