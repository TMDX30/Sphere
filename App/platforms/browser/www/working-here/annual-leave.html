        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Introduction</div>
        <p>
          Much of the organisation operates on a fairly informal basis in terms of taking annual leave. This will vary with the requirements of your team, so it is recommended that you check the established process for your area with your line manager.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Booking leave</div>
        <p>
          The majority of staff use the outlook calendar service to confirm leave appointments with their manager. In order to avoid possible disappointment, it is advisable to give at least two weeks prior notice. It is generally uncommon for a manager to reject
          a leave request; however, in extenuating circumstances such as high work volume or low staffing levels, your manager may say no, or ask you to reduce your leave request.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Full time</div>
        <p>
          You will initially receive 25 days of annual leave. After each year of service you will receive an additional day until you reach a cap of 30 days. If you are transferring from another government department, your annual leave entitlement will depend on
          whether you are on modernised or pre-modernised terms and conditions. HR will be able to provide you with your entitlement before or after you join.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Part time</div>
        <p>
          Things work slightly differently for part time workers. You will get annual leave and bank holidays on a pro-rata basis. This means that our HR department will calculate your leave and privilege days based on your hours and entitlement.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Holidays</div>
        <p>
          You will not be required to work on days that are a bank holiday in Wales. In addition, as a member of the civil service you will receive an additional day of privilege leave for the Queen’s birthday. If you already have a holiday booked before you join
          us, it would be helpful to let HR know before you start. This will allow us to notify your new team.
        </p>
        <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Making time corrections</div>
        <p>
          The office allows staff members to authorise their own annual leave and fix time errors on our electronic time keeping system Etarmis®. This empowers staff to make corrections to their own logged time, without having to wait for manager approval. You
          are trusted to make use of this system fairly. Managers will review your logged time periodically. You may be disciplined in the event that you are found to be abusing the trust provided by this system. Etarmis® software can be accessed at your
          work station.
