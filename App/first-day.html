                    You may bring your own lunch if you like but we have a canteen, shop, Coffee shop and cash machine on site which are all very close to each other. More information on this can be found in the facilities section (Page link). It might be useful to bring
                    a pen but stationary will likely be provided to you. If you have been asked to bring any additional documents in your welcome pack, please make sure that you have them to hand.

                    You will find that there is a kitchen near your team. You may bring your own tea/coffee/milk, buy it from the shop or join a "milk club" within your area, where you have the option to pay in and share a large container of milk.

                    The dress code may vary depending on which department you are working in, however “smart casual” are the usual guidelines. Some areas tend to dress smarter than others and some also choose to dress more casual on a Friday.

                    On your first day, you should dress smartly and going forward you will quickly be able to assess how your area dresses. If in doubt, you should contact us for advice beforehand.

                    On the morning of your first day go to IPO main reception where the front desk staff will be able to assist you. You will be given a temporary photographic pass for the day but will get a permanent pass within the week. The main desk will then notify
                    the person that will welcome you to the office. It may take a while to get used to finding your way around the office. If you are ever lost, be sure to ask someone and they will happily direct you to wherever you may need to go.

                    All new members of staff are required to undergo a security briefing by the IPO Secure Team on their first day. This has to be completed before you are given your login credentials for IT and issued with your staff pass. Usually, a security briefing is
                    pre-booked for the morning of your first day at the IPO.

                    You will be briefed on your working hours on your first day as these are usually set for the first week/s due to training/workshops/briefings etc. If agreed with your manager, you will be able to take advantage our flexible working patterns depending
                    on your role.
