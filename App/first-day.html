                <p>
                    You may bring your own lunch if you like but we have a canteen, shop and costa on site and cash machine which is located by the canteen. Bring a pen just in case but stationary will likely be provided to you.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">What to wear</div>
                <p>
                    At the IPO there isn't a specific dress code but in general most staff stick to smart casual.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Where to go</div>
                <p>
                    On the morning of your first day go to main reception where the front desk staff will be able to assist you. You will be given a temporary photographic pass for the day but will get a permanent pass within the week. The main desk will then notify the
                    person that will welcome you to the office.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">What to expect</div>
                <p>
                    All new members of staff are required to undergo a security briefing by the IPO Secure Team on their first day. This has to be completed before you are given your login credentials for IT and issued with your staff pass. Usually, a security briefing is
                    pre-booked for the morning of your first day at the IPO.
