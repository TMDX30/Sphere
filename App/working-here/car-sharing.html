                <p>
                    The IPO offers a car sharing scheme. This is when two or more people travel together to and from work. This could be beneficial in a number of ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convenience of a car without using your own, if you are a passenger.</li>
                    <li>Reducing mileage and petrol costs.</li>
                    <li>Alleviating parking problems, congestion and pollution.</li>
                    <li>A guaranteed taxi ride home in an emergency.</li>
                    <li>Â£25 given to you to say thank you for helping staff and the environment.</li>
                    <li>Use of the convenient dedicated car sharing parking spaces on days you car share.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Requirements</div>
                <p>
                    To be able to use these spaces you need to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>have a car share pass, which is obtainable from accommodation when you are registered.</li>
                    <li>be sharing your journey with a member of staff who work in either the Intellectual Property Office or Office of National Statistics.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Finding matches</div>
                <p>
                    When registered you will get access to the Liftshare service. You can use this to find matches with other members who may live close to you. Alternatively if you already have a colleague in mind, you can go ahead and sign up together with accommodation.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Site map</div>
                <p>
                  You may find the site map below useful for finding reserved car share parking spaces:
