                    The office offers nursery facilities at Acorns Nursery, part of the Office of National Statistics, our neighbouring office. This purpose built nursery cares for 33 children each day, with babies being cared for in their own suite of rooms.

                    The nursery is equipped to the highest standards and our spacious gardens provide areas for children to play, rest and learn about the great outdoors. A particular favourite are the vegetable boxes where they plant their own fruit and vegetables which
                    are then harvested for Cath our Cook to use in her delicious homemade dishes!

                    Mr Pahl our Early Years Teacher helps prepare the children for the journey to big school, whilst Nursery Manager Amanda, her Assistant Claire and their team of highly qualified Nursery Nurses encourage happy well-rounded children who maximise their learning
                    potential through fun activities and play.
