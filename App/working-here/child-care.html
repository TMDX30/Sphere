                <p>
                    Staff who pay for registered childcare services for their pre-school children can apply for childcare vouchers to help with the cost. The vouchers are valued at Â£20.00 per week for qualifying full time staff, or pro-rated for part time staff based on their hours worked. We also offer a salary sacrifice scheme. When you arrive in the Office, you will be able to search our local intranet service 'Circle' for further eligibility details.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Nursery</div>
                <p>
                    The office offers a nursery facility on site called 'Acorns Nursery'. This part of the Office of National Statistics, our neighbouring office. This purpose built nursery cares for 33 children each day, with babies being cared for in their own suite of rooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nursery is equipped to the highest standards and our spacious gardens provide areas for children to play, rest and learn about the great outdoors. A particular favourite are the vegetable boxes where they plant their own fruit and vegetables which are then harvested for Cath our Cook to use in her delicious homemade dishes!

                    Mr Pahl our Early Years Teacher helps prepare the children for their journey to school, whilst Nursery Manager Amanda, her Assistant Claire and their team of highly qualified Nursery Nurses encourage happy well-rounded children by maximising their learning potential through fun activities and play.
