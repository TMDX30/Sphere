                    Staff who pay for registered childcare for their pre-school children can apply for childcare vouchers to help with their costs. The vouchers are valued at Â£20:00 per week for qualifying full time staff, or pro-rated for part time staff based on the hours
                    worked.

                    great outdoors.
