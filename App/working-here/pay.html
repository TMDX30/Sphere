                    The IPO pay staff on a monthly basis. You should be paid on the penultimate working day of the month. The pay you receive in your first month will be worked out using your start date. This is because it will be calculated against the number of days you
                    have worked in that first month. Thereafter, it will revert to your standard monthly salary.
                </p>

                  If you are used to weekly payments and are struggling with moving to a monthly payment, in exceptional circumstances you can put in a request to HR and Payroll to receive a fortnightly payment for the month only.

                    To ensure that you get paid on time, it is vitally important that you have completed and returned all the relevant documents that have been sent to you by the Recruitment team.
