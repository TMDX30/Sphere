                <p>
                    ‘Cycle to work’ is designed to promote healthier journeys to work and to reduce environmental pollution. It allows employers to loan cycles and cycle safety equipment to staff as a tax-free benefit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can choose to purchase a bicycle through the “IPO: On Your Bike” scheme. This consists of a small contribution taken from your pay each month for 12 months. This is open to all staff.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Cost</div>
                <p>
                    You can sacrifice up to £1000 of your annual wage over the 12 months as long as this doesn’t take your wage lower than the national minimum wage. Staff who do want to take part in the scheme but the cost would take them below national minimum wage an
                    extension of the 12 months will be considered.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">What about leisure?</div>
                <p>
                    No, you can definitely use it for leisure purposes! Guidelines say that 50% of the bike use is to be used for getting to and from work.
                </p>
