                    Much of the organisation operates on a fairly informal basis in terms of taking annual leave. Check the process in your area with you line manager when you arrive, but most people are able to send their manager an appointment for leave (probably best
                    to give about a weeks’ notice) which will then be either accepted or rejected by your line manager. 99.9% of times, your manager will accept your leave but occasionally (for example during times of low-staffing) then your manager reserves
                    the right to say no.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The office has also recently allowed staff to authorise Annual Leave on the Etarmis® system, so you won't have to wait for your manager to add your time back on. Managers do check this periodically and you can be disciplined for incorrect use of this,
                    but your manager will explain all that to you once you join the team.

                    You will initially receive 25 days of annual leave. After each year of service you will receive an additional day until you reach a cap of 30 days. If you are transferring from another government department, your annual leave entitlement will depend on
                    whether you are on modernised or pre-modernised terms and conditions and HR will be able to provide you with your entitlement before or when you join.

                    In broad terms you will get annual leave and bank holidays on a pro-rata basis. This means that our HR department will work out your leave and privilege days based on your hours.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Holidays</div>
                <p>
                    You will not be required to work bank holidays and will receive an additional day of privilege leave for the Queen’s birthday. Before booking leave, it is useful to have a chat to your manager about how much notice they usually like to have and if there
                    are any reasons why your team might need cover at particular times. If you already have a holiday booked before you join us, it would be helpful to let HR know before you join, so that your new line manager knows about it.
