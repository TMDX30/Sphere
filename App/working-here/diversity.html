                <p>
                  Equality is concerned with ensuring that everyone is given equal access to opportunities which allow them to contribute and participate fully and fairly in the workplace and in society.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Equality is about removing barriers. It doesn't mean excluding some people or giving one group preferential treatment over another, although sometimes we can take steps to help remove the barriers faced by certain groups; for example, providing wheelchair access to public buildings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You have the right to a working life free from discrimination, victimisation or harassment.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">LGBT</div>
                <p>
                  The IPO has its own LGBT network called iPride. iPride aims to promote inclusivity and encourage participation from its members. They provide confidential support and advice on sexual orientation or gender identity issues. They also aim to update colleagues interested in LGBT matters, and most of all provide a means of peer support between LGBT staff.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Disability</div>
                <p>
                  Concept House aims to be fully accessible for all of its staff members. The office has disability access at all entrances and provides lifts for ease of access to all floors. Disabled toilets are located on each floor within close proximity of male and female toilets. The canteen and shop are fully wheelchair accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have a disability or suffer from a long-term health condition, you should discuss any help you need to carry out your job to the best of your ability with your line manager. This will ensure that any reasonable adjustments can be put into place and that you access the support and assistance available from the Office and colleagues.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Mental Health</div>
                <p>
                  A mental health problem can feel just as bad, or worse, as any other physical illness â€“ only you cannot always see it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We value the physical and mental health of our people and our Mental Health Strategy sets out our vision of an organisation where mental health issues are widely understood and de-stigmatised. Our people will feel confident to talk about their mental health and know that the Office will help and support them.
