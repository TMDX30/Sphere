                <p>
                    The IPO values the health of its employees and encourages an active life style. We have our very own gym on site that is available to all staff. If you’re worried about your colleagues after a particularly intense workout session, fear not, showers and changing rooms are located nearby.
                </p>
                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">Gym</div>
                <p>
                    The gym offers members free one on one sessions with a qualified personal trainer. These sessions can be adjusted to meet your needs. A personal trainer can help you develop a personalised fitness plan, monitor your progress or simply provide you with a good grounding in fitness activities.

                <div class="content-block-title paragraph-heading">CSSC</div>
                <p>
                    To join you need to be a member of <a href="http://www.cssc.co.uk/home.aspx" target="_blank">CSSC</a>.  It costs what we believe is a very reasonable £25 per year. This is cheaper than the monthly cost of the majority of gyms! However, if the IPO gym is not for you, you may also be able to get a discount on the monthly cost of a local gym
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subscription to CSSC is £3.70 per month, which can also be deducted through payroll monthly or paid annually. When you become a CSSC member you will receive a Countdown savings card which entitles you to receive discount at most high street stores.

                <p>
                    In addition, the IPO offers a number of more specialised fitness classes. These can be a great opportunity to socialise with other people in the office. Some examples include; Yoga, Kettlebells, Zumba and running groups. The cost of each session will vary.
