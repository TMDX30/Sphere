# Sphere

An app for people new or returning to the organisation. 

This app has been developed as a team project by the 'After School Club'. It is heavily work in progress, meaning that the content and design could be subject to rapid and large changes. 

The app is based on <a href="https://framework7.io/">Framework7</a> an open source mobile HTML framework.

## Installation

Requires:
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
- <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>

#### 1. Download or clone this repo.

#### 2. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a>

#### 3. Install <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> globally.

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

#### 4. Install project dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```


## Usage

Because Framework7 uses Ajax for navigation between pages you will need a server. You may use Gulp's server. Just run:

```
$ gulp server
```

The app will be available on <a href="http://localhost:3000/App/">http://localhost:3000/App/</a>
