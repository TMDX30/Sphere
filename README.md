# Sphere

An app for people new or returning to the organisation. 

This app has been developed as a team project by the 'After School Club'. It is heavily work in progress. Content and design could be subject to rapid and large change. 

The app is based on <a href="https://framework7.io/">Framework7</a> an open source mobile HTML framework.

## Installation

Requires:
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>
- <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>

#### 1. Download or clone this repo.

#### 2. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.

#### 3. Install <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> globally.

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
```

#### 4. Install project dependencies.

Run the following command from the project root:

```sh
$ npm install
```


## Usage

Because Framework7 uses Ajax for navigation between pages you will need a web server. Gulp includes its own server that you can use. Run the command:

```
$ gulp server
```

The app will be available on <a href="http://localhost:3000/App/">http://localhost:3000/App/</a>
